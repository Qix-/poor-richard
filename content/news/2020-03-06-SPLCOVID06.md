There are two “presumed positive” cases of the new coronavirus in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Friday.

The cases of COVID-19, in Delaware County and Wayne County, still need to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Wolf said. The affected people, who are adults, have been quarantined in their homes.

“We all should remain calm here,” Wolf said, adding that the state Department of Health is leading the state’s efforts. “I can assure you that our state government will continue to function smoothly.”

He said he will sign a disaster declaration on Friday. 

Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the cases were not transmitted in the community, but were from travel.

Officials announced earlier in the week that the state lab in Exton is now <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-testing-state-labs/" target="_blank">testing</a> COVID-19 samples. As of Friday, the lab can handle between 20 and 25 samples a day. By the weekend, the lab will be able to do 125 to 150 assessments a day, according to Levine.

“We are prepared,” Levine said, later adding there is no testing backlog. 

Five schools in Bucks County are closed Friday after students and staff attended an event with a person diagnosed with COVID-19. “There are no confirmed cases in Bucks County,” Levine said.

Levine said Pennsylvanians should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds to protect themselves. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
