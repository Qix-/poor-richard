The Pennsylvania State Police will begin enforcing Gov. Tom Wolf’s order for [all but “life-sustaining” businesses](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fhealth%2Fcoronavirus%2Fspl%2Fpennsylvania-shutdown-lifesustaining-businesses-tom-wolf-shut-down-20200319.html) to close their physical operations Monday at 8 a.m.

In a statement, Colonel Robert Evanchick, commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police, said “private businesses, organizations, and other noncompliant entities face possible criminal penalties.” The violations are summary offenses punishable by fines and jail time.

Other agencies involved with enforcement include the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, and “local officials, using their resources to enforce closure orders within their jurisdictions."

"Troopers and liquor control officers will make every effort to achieve voluntary compliance by educating business owners and using discretion when appropriate,” Evanchick said. "But our message is clear: COVID-19 is a serious health and public safety risk that requires an extraordinary response from law enforcement and the public."

Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Sunday that Pennsylvania officials are discussing a possible shelter-in-place order, but no decisions have been made.

"We’ll be seeing in the coming days which decisions are necessary to protect the public health of Pennsylvania,” Levine said, adding that such an order would not apply to grocery stores.

Since Saturday, there have been 108 new cases of COVID-19 reported. The statewide total is 479 people in 33 counties. 

Approximately 47 of those infected have required hospitalization since March 6, Levine said — roughly 10% of cases. "Our data so far indicates that approximately 4% of cases have required intensive care and approximately 2% have required ventilators," Levine said. 

Levine said tests are available not only through the state but through commercial labs including Quest. She reiterated that people with no or mild symptoms should not seek a test, although they can contact their health provider. 

"I don’t see a time when we’ll be testing asymptomatic people in the future,” she said.
