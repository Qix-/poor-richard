HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf recently tested negative for the coronavirus after being alerted to a potential exposure, his office said Monday.

The governor was tested after his office was contacted by someone who had been near Wolf and who was showing symptoms of the illness, a spokesperson said. That person was also tested and found to be negative, according to the office.

“The measure was taken out of an abundance of caution,” the spokesperson, Lyndsay Kensinger, said. “We do not have any evidence that the governor has been in contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19."

The governor is working remotely but is not in quarantine.

“Most cabinet secretaries along with agency executive and management staff are working remotely to make sure that we have continuity of government as the commonwealth responds to the spread of COVID-19,” Kensinger said.

Wolf has in the past week been conducting briefings separately from Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who has been providing updates from the state’s emergency management headquarters outside Harrisburg. His public schedule, which is posted on his government website, has not been updated since March 5, the day before Wolf declared a disaster emergency as the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Pennsylvania.

That week, his schedule shows, the governor was in Philadelphia, Montgomery, and Monroe Counties — areas that reported some of the earliest cases of the virus.

Most of the state’s six legislative leaders, some of whom are scheduled to be in the Capitol this week, said they are not exhibiting any symptoms and had not been tested.

One — House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster) — said he did not want to share any medical information about himself. Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) did not respond to questions.

Though testing for COVID-19 has increased in the past week — with hospitals, health systems, and private labs either taking samples, administering tests, or both — mass testing is not widely available.

Levine has urged people who are asymptomatic or who have mild symptoms to stay home and reach out to a doctor if needed. She said testing is being prioritized for people who are exhibiting severe symptoms, have an underlying health condition, are elderly, or are health care workers.
