**Q: How will the shutdown of many businesses and subsequent economic impact affect the suicide rate in Pennsylvania?**

A: No one can say for sure since a lot of different factors affect suicide, but plenty of research links economic hardship and unemployment to increased suicide rates, [especially in the U.S.](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/0227-5910/a000487)

Two prominent researchers [who spoke with The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-deaths-despair-future-capitalis-angus-deaton-anne-case-20200319.html) said, “it would not be an unreasonable prediction that suicide rates and drinking and drug overdose would go up during this pandemic.”

In the last several years, researchers have been finding links between stagnant wages, decimated unions, outsourced labor, and the decreasing social and economic value of a high school diploma to higher rates of death from suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related liver disease.

Experts are trying to help by providing [tips on caring for your mental health](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-mental-health-social-distancing-20200319.html) during the pandemic.

If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, call the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or contact the Crisis Line by texting “PA” to 741741.

**Q: I work at a warehouse. Where can my business donate my N95 masks?**

A: The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency and the state Department of Health are accepting donations of supplies that may be needed to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

Businesses should contact PEMA at [pabeoc@pa.gov](mailto:pabeoc@pa.gov) and the health department at [Ra-dhcovidquestions@pa.gov](mailto:Ra-dhcovidquestions@pa.gov).

In the initial email, you should include the name of your company, contact information, the type of item, and the amount of items you want to donate.

What if you are not a business, but still want to help?

“For the general public, we want people to take action to help others,” said Nate Wardle, a spokesperson for the health department. While the best way to help is staying home, individuals can donate blood and non-perishable items to food banks while practicing social distancing.

Wardle added, “Often, during disasters, the donation of items can cause more of a concern, because items donated may not be what is needed,” he said.

**Q: Should Narcotics Anonymous meetings close?**

A: At this point, most in-person meetings of Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous have been canceled, and many have moved online. Advocates say meetings in southeastern Pennsylvania, which often attracted groups of 50 or more people, were the first to close. But many smaller meetings in the rest of the state are following suit, as the churches and rec centers which host them are closing their doors.

Here are some resources to learn about canceled in-person meetings and find online alternatives:

**Q: Why aren’t supermarkets limiting the number of people allowed in the stores?** 

**A:** Because there are too many of us, said Alex Baloga, president of the Pennsylvania Food Merchants Association.

“We are trying to make sure they are open and available,” and meeting the increased demand for food and supplies.

“It would be difficult to accommodate,” he said, but many supermarkets are now reducing their hours to clean and disinfect items in the stores.

**Q: My boss decided to stay open, but I do not have any vacation days or sick days. Can I receive unemployment?** 

**A:** Yes, but you have to let your boss know about your coronavirus concerns and give them a chance to address the issues. 

If your personal health or the health of your family is at risk by going into work, then you may have “necessitous and compelling” reasons to voluntarily leave employment, according to Julia Simon-Mishel, a supervising attorney in the unemployment compensation unit at Philadelphia Legal Assistance.

If an employer refuses to address your concerns, then you can take a leave of absence or quit, and you should be able to receive unemployment, she said. 

This is also true if you are now unable to get transportation to work, Simon-Mishel said. 

If you tell your employer you have health concerns and are fired, you should also be eligible for benefits. 

Simon-Mishel recommends you inform your employer in writing and keep evidence of that.
