**Q: Should Narcotics Anonymous meetings close?**

A: At this point, most in-person meetings of Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous have been canceled, and many have moved online. Advocates say meetings in southeastern Pennsylvania, which often attracted groups of 50 or more people, were the first to close. But many smaller meetings in the rest of the state are following suit, as the churches and rec centers which host them are closing their doors.

Here are some resources to learn about canceled in-person meetings and find online alternatives:

**Q: Why aren’t supermarkets limiting the number of people allowed in the stores? — Kevin M.**

**A:** Because there are too many of us, said Alex Baloga, president of the Pennsylvania Food Merchants Association.

“We are trying to make sure they are open and available,” and meeting the increased demand for food and supplies.

“It would be difficult to accommodate,” he said, but many supermarkets are now reducing their hours to clean and disinfect items in the stores.

**Q: My boss decided to stay open, but I do not have any vacation days or sick days. Can I receive unemployment? — Beth D.**

**A:** Yes, but you have to let your boss know about your coronavirus concerns and give them a chance to address the issues. 

If your personal health or the health of your family is at risk by going into work, then you may have “necessitous and compelling” reasons to voluntarily leave employment, according to Julia Simon-Mishel, a supervising attorney in the unemployment compensation unit at Philadelphia Legal Assistance.

If an employer refuses to address your concerns, then you can take a leave of absence or quit, and you should be able to receive unemployment, she said. 

This is also true if you are now unable to get transportation to work, Simon-Mishel said. 

If you tell your employer you have health concerns and are fired, you should also be eligible for benefits. 

Simon-Mishel recommends you inform your employer in writing and keep evidence of that.
