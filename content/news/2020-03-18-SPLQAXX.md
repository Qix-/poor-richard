<b>Q: My boss decided to stay open, but I do not have any vacation days or sick days. Can I receive unemployment? — Beth D.</b>

<b>A:</b> Yes, but you have to let your boss know about your coronavirus concerns and give them a chance to address the issues. 

If your personal health or the health of your family is at risk by going into work, then you may have “necessitous and compelling” reasons to voluntarily leave employment, according to Julia Simon-Mishel, a supervising attorney in the unemployment compensation unit at Philadelphia Legal Assistance.

If an employer refuses to address your concerns, then you can take a leave of absence or quit, and you should be able to receive unemployment, she said. 

This is also true if you are now unable to get transportation to work, Simon-Mishel said. 

If you tell your employer you have health concerns and are fired, you should also be eligible for benefits. 

Simon-Mishel recommends you inform your employer in writing and keep evidence of that.
