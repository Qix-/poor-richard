House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny), one of Pennsylvania’s most powerful conservative leaders, said Thursday morning that he will not seek reelection and will instead pursue a job in the private sector.

While hardly a household name, Turzai has for the better part of a decade helped set the policy agenda in the Capitol, championing fiscal restraint, government privatization and restrictions on abortion rights. He has also been a prolific fund-raiser for Republican legislative candidates across the state.

In making the announcement Thursday in his suburban Pittsburgh office, Turzai was visibly emotional, saying that he had had many discussions with his family over the last few months about his future. One of his sons, he said, made a baseball analogy and told him that the last day he pitches “is going to be so hard — but there is going to be a last day.”

“I am only telling you at this time that I am not running again,” he said, later adding: “I’ve made this decision knowing I’ve left it all on the field.”

Turzai, 60, did not say whether he intends to complete his term, which ends Nov. 30th. If he leaves the legislature before then, there could be a special election to fill his seat.

A lawyer, Turzai arrived in the House in 2001 after winning a special election and has been the speaker since 2015. Before that he had been the GOP majority leader for three years.

The speaker also did not say whether he had any plans to run for higher office. In <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pennsylvania-speaker-of-the-house-mike-turzai-to-retire" >an interview</a> with the Washington Examiner earlier this week, he said he will not compete in the open race for governor in 2022, despite having evinced interest, including in a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/clout/pennsylvania-society-mike-turzai-2022-governor-race-20191207.html" >December interview with Clout</a>, the politics column of the Philadelphia Inquirer. He declared for the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/mike-turzai-diner-interview-for-governor-race-20171115.html" >GOP primary for governor in 2017</a> but in the end did not run.

Still, Turzai’s announcement quelled the rampant speculation about his future tearing through the Capitol all this week, distracting policy makers.

His departure is expected to set the stage later this year for what could be some rather sharp jousting in the contest to succeed him.

Once Turzai leaves office, the House can move to elect a new speaker — and the race for the position could be competitive. The stakes are high: it’s a pivotal election year, and Democrats believe they have their best chance in years to seize control of the House. Turzai, aside from setting the House Republicans’ agenda, raised millions of dollars to help GOP candidates in legislative races.

Any successor would be expected to do the same.

Several names have already bubbled to the surface as possible replacements: Rep. Stan Saylor, a Republican from York County who runs the powerful House Appropriations Committee; Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster) — although he only last year assumed the majority leader position, it arguably is almost as powerful as the Speaker’s job; and Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R., Centre), the House’s majority whip.

Another scenario that has been discussed: If Turzai retires before his term ends, Republicans could rally behind Rep. Marcy Toepel (R. Montgomery), who has already said she is not running for reelection, to serve as Speaker for the remainder of the year. Then, the fight for the Speaker’s job would be pushed to after the election, when lawmakers would select leaders for the next two-year session, which begins in 2021.

Pennsylvania has never had a female House Speaker.
