HARRISBURG — The top Republican in the Pennsylvania Senate announced late Wednesday that he is not running for reelection, becoming the second ranking GOP lawmaker in the Capitol to seek retirement in a pivotal election year.

Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) said in a statement that his decision was “personal, not political,” and that he looked forward to spending more time with his family after nearly 20 years in the legislature.

“I have worked with five governors and throughout this time I am proud to have been a leading advocate for rural Pennsylvania values,” Scarnati said in a statement.

Scarnati has for the better part of a decade helped set the policy agenda in the Capitol. He has also been a prolific fundraiser for Republican legislative candidates across the state, a role he was widely expected to step into again in this critical election year, when Democrats in both chambers are seeking to take the majority.

Scarnati is the second top Republican to announce his retirement. In January, House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) said [he will not run](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/mike-turzai-pennsylvania-house-speaker-retiring/ "https\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/mike-turzai-pennsylvania-house-speaker-retiring/") for another two-year-term.
