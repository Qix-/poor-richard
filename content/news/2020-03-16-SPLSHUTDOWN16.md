HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday extended his shutdown order to the entire state as the number of coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania continued to grow.

The shutdown directive, which applies to nonessential businesses in all 67 counties, begins at midnight and will be in place for two weeks, said Wolf, who urged residents to “stay calm, stay safe, stay home."

“This isn’t a decision that I take lightly at all,” the governor said at his administration’s daily briefing at the state’s emergency management headquarters on Monday. “It’s one that I’m making because medical experts believe it is the only way we can prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed by patients.”

The governor had previously placed four counties — Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery — in a similar lockdown. Late last week, he also closed all public schools statewide for two weeks.

Though Wolf has [broad powers in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-tom-wolf-emergency-powers-pennsylvania/ "https\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-tom-wolf-emergency-powers-pennsylvania/"), his shutdown orders have generally involved asking nonessential businesses like gyms, salons, theaters and concert venues to close for 14 days. He has repeatedly said he will not order state law enforcement officials to enforce the closures — instead, he said, he expects “self-enforcement.”

The governor and his health secretary, Rachel Levine, have also urged residents in areas under shutdown to avoid any nonessential travel, stay away from large gatherings, and keep a six-foot distance between themselves and others.

Wolf reiterated on Monday that essential government and medical services will continue, and that pharmacies, grocery stores, health care facilities, and gas stations should stay open.

Asked about daycare centers, the governor indicated that they fall under the shutdown order, but said his administration will not enforce their closure.

“At at this point, we are calling for child care facilities to close, but we are not sending out the State Police or the National Guard to enforce this,” he said. “This is what they ought to do."

Late Sunday, Wolf ordered restaurants in the four counties then under lockdown, as well as Allegheny County, to close their dine-in facilities. As part of his statewide shutdown order, that will now apply to restaurants statewide. Takeout service may continue, Wolf said.

State-run liquor stores will also shut down indefinitely at 9 p.m. Tuesday, although consumers can still purchase wine and beer at grocery stores that carry them, according to officials at the state’s Liquor Control Board.

The state Gaming Control Board also announced Monday that it had instructed any casinos still open to begin shutting down. And Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court declared a statewide judicial emergency until April 14, 2020, during which county president judges can, among other changes, restrict or temporarily close court facilities and authorize using technology to conduct court proceedings.

Levine said as of Monday morning, 76 Pennsylvania residents had tested positive for the virus, including 30 people in Montgomery County and eight in Philadelphia, where Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration has now [ordered all nonessential businesses to shut down](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/philadelphia-shutdown-coronavirus-20200316.html "https\://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/philadelphia-shutdown-coronavirus-20200316.html"). The city is also closing city government buildings to the public and halting all nonessential city services this week.

For the first time Monday, state health officials said that “one or two” cases involving people who tested positive for COVID-19 could not be traced to a known source of infection — for instance, travel to an impacted area or contact to an infected person — suggesting the virus is spreading in the community.

For the moment, that spread appears contained. But they said they expect that to change

“We have not reached that threshold of sustained community spread in any area,” Levine, the state health secretary. “That doesn’t mean we won’t. And actually, we fully expect that we will see sustained community spread.”

The disaster emergency declaration Wolf signed on March 6 to help his administration cope with the public health crisis gives the governor vast powers. Aside from shutting down businesses, Wolf could also limit travel, order evacuations, and even commandeer private property.
