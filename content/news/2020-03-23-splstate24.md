HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf issued a “stay-at-home” order today for Philadelphia and its suburbs, as well as Monroe and Allegheny counties, taking the fight against the coronavirus to a new level by requiring residents to remain inside except for essential trips such as buying food or seeking medical help.

The order applies to Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties in the southeast, Monroe County in the northeast, and Allegheny County in Western Pennsylvania.

The order takes effect at 8 p.m. and will remain in place for two weeks, Wolf said. Also, the governor extended school closures in Pennsylvania for another two weeks.

"These restrictions are unlike anything we've experienced before," Wolf said at a news conference. "If we want to save lives, we must distance ourselves socially. This is going to be difficult."

Wolf’s order comes a day after Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/stay-at-home-order-kenney-covid-19-coronavirus-wolf-murphy-20200323.html" target=_blank>issued a similar order</a> for the city’s 1.6 million residents.

In Philadelphia, all public and private gatherings of any number of people that occur outside a single household are banned, except for limited exceptions outlined in Kenney’s order. The work of designated “essential businesses” and “essential personnel” continues as before.

People in the city can leave homes to care for family members, friends, or pets in another household, to deliver essential goods, and to report to a job that’s related to an essential business.
