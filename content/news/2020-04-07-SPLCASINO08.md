As the coronavirus spread across the region last month and Gov. Wolf ordered a halt to all but life-sustaining business, construction workers on the site of the new Live! Hotel &amp; Casino in South Philadelphia were growing increasingly concerned for their safety.

They reported to work each day, but many fretted that the general contractor, Gilbane Building Company, wasn’t doing enough to protect them from being infected.

While many businesses shut down, construction continued on the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/cordish-philadelphia-stadium-casino-seeks-pennsylvania-license-renewal-20190507.html" target=_blank>$700 million casino</a>, one of the most expensive projects in the city. Hundreds of workers traveled to the site on Packer Avenue near Citizens Bank Park — some from as far away as New York and Maryland.

On March 26, a positive COVID-19 case surfaced. The worker had been on the project for two days, most recently on March 17.

“Yesterday afternoon we were notified that a taper that worked on the Live! Hotel &amp; Casino project tested positive for the COVID-19 virus,” Gilbane project executive Dan Kelley wrote in an email obtained by the Inquirer, listing people who might have had contact with the infected man.

Some workers responded by walking off the site, convinced that Gilbane was not taking the coronavirus seriously.  Another wave of workers left on Monday after their union head said his workers were “in danger.”

“We were like, ‘We’re not working here,’” said a construction worker who asked not to be identified. “Most of our guys felt this was bull crap. Some of these guys don’t care, but this spreads like wildfire.”

Gilbane, an international development company, had been allowed to push ahead with construction by obtaining a waiver from the Wolf administration. As of Monday, they were planning to keep building. But their actions at the casino site have now been called into question by state officials.

“An exemption was granted to Gilbane Construction, but that exemption does not allow for casino construction,” Casey Smith, a spokesperson for the state Department of Community and Economic Development, said Monday, in response to questions from the Inquirer.

Smith said Tuesday that the waiver was granted to Gilbane only for “projects that pose public safety hazard due to current condition, need for life safety completion, healthcare construction" and, in one case, a school in Philadelphia that is needed to eliminate student overcrowding.

“Per guidance, when a company receives an exemption in response to a request in which it specifically identified a particular element of the business as essential to health care or another life-sustaining operation, that exemption only relates to those specified life-sustaining activities,” Smith said.

Shortly after Wolf ordered all but life-sustaining businesses to shut down on March 19, he set up a process for companies to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-business-waivers-life-sustaining-application-close/" target="_blank">apply for waivers to continue operations</a>. But the administration has given few details about how the process works and have refused repeated requests to provide a list of who has applied to reopen, what they said their life-sustaining business is, and why they were approved or denied.

Gilbane declined this week to answer questions about how many workers at the casino site tested positive or negative for COVID-19 or how it obtained the exemption to the state shutdown.

Nor did Cordish Cos., the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/tourism_casinos/stadium-casino-parx-cordish-corporate-restructuring-extension-20181121.html" target="_blank">Baltimore-based casino operator and developer</a> that took control of the project developer, Stadium Casino LLC, in November 2018.

“In the case of the casino project, the building is still exposed to the elements and requires critical enclosure and infrastructure work to be completed before construction work can be safely paused,” Cordish said in a statement Monday. “The safety of all workers on the casino job and all construction jobs in the region is paramount.”

Cordish said the company has adopted protocols consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, including social-distancing requirements, hand-washing stations, and staggered shifts to limit the number of workers on site together.

“The casino, when completed, will bring thousands of new jobs and hundreds of millions of new taxes to Philadelphia and the Commonwealth, at a time when both will be critically needed,” the company said. “While other gaming companies have cut tens of thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth and shelved planned investments, we are continuing to invest $1 billion in the region to create these new jobs and taxes, despite the economic environment.”

Lauren Cox, a spokesperson for Mayor Jim Kenney, said the city was not involved in Gilbane obtaining a waiver from the state. She said the site “should be taking every precaution to keep its employees safe," including by maintaining a 6-foot distance between workers and wearing masks.

That hasn’t always been happening, workers say.

In an email sent to his employees on April 1, a subcontractor at the site said he had been informed that day that a casino site worker had tested positive for COVID-19, but that workers were to return to the site on Monday.

“PPE [personal protective equipment] is extremely scarce as most understand at this point and we will continue to refine and change our program based on this,” wrote Michael Jackson, vice president of Philadelphia D&amp;M. “We look forward to finishing this project with the vigor we started with, all the while keeping YOU, our employees and multi-employer trade partners as safe as we can in our current climate.”

Attached to the email were PDM “infection control procedures for projects where social distancing is not feasible,” as well as a flier from the general contractor titled “Gilbane Cares.” It said workers should not be on site if they feel sick, have a fever or breathing issues, have traveled outside of government travel restrictions, or have been in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19.

“If you answer NO to all of the above, please come to work,” the Gilbane flier states.

On Monday, Gary Masino, president of Sheet Metal Workers’ Local 19, sent a letter to his members informing them that all members were being pulled from the casino site, as well as two other Philadelphia job sites, because the union leadership felt that general contractors there were “not complying with the CDC regulations and preventative precautions” regarding the coronavirus.

“We felt that the workers on those projects were in danger,” Masino wrote.
