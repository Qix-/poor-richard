## Community Engagement Fellow

### Community Engagement Fellow Spotlight PA The Data Desk at Temple University

The Data Desk at Temple University is seeking to hire an engagement fellow, who will be embedded with the reporting team at [Spotlight PA](https://spotlightpa.org/). This is a yearlong, paid fellowship for a motivated recent graduate or soon-to-be-graduated senior interested in helping grow Spotlight PA’s online and offline audience. This is an outstanding opportunity for someone interested in audience development and community engagement.

Launched last year and based in Harrisburg, Spotlight PA produces non­partisan, investigative journalism about Pennsylvania government and urgent statewide issues. Our collaborative newsroom is powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Pittsburgh Post­-Gazette and PennLive/The Patriot-News.

Working with Spotlight PA’s leadership team, the fellow will help develop the organization’s presence across all social channels, newsletters and perhaps events. The goal is to ensure Spotlight PA’s work has the most reach and impact possible.

This is not a role for a pageview chaser; this is someone who wants to make a difference, and understands how impact-driven journalism can do that. Spotlight PA is committed to hiring employees from diverse backgrounds with excellent investigative journalism skills. People of color, women, LGBTQ and people with disabilities are encouraged to apply.

Ideally, this person:

* Will have previous internship / work experience in social media and audience engagement;
* Will be able to leverage analytics to develop best practices for growth and engagement;
* Will be up to the challenge of helping define the social identity of the Spotlight PA brand;
* Will be interested in maximizing growth of social channels (primarily Facebook and Instagram) as a pathway to connect with readers;
* Will want to build a platform for big, creative and innovative new ideas to connect our content with communities/community leaders across the state;
* Is energetic, with crazy attention to detail.

This position will be based at the Spotlight PA newsroom in Harrisburg, PA and will begin in the summer. This is a full-time contract position at a rate equal to $40,000 per year. To apply, please send a resume and cover letter to: [jobs@newscatalyst.org](mailto:jobs@newscatalyst.org)
