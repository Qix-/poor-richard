Spotlight PA combines the strengths of [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com), [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com) and [PennLive/The Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com) in a historic commitment to investigative reporting on state government and beyond. Additional partners — including [PA Post](https://papost.org), a project of [WITF](http://www.witf.org), and [LNP Media Group](https://lnpmediagroup.com)/[The Caucus](https://caucuspa.com/) — allow us to share resources and maximize audience and reporting power. We intend to provide our content **free of charge** to newsrooms across the state to help bolster local media and better inform the public.
